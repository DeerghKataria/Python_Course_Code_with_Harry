a = {1, 3, 4, 5, 1}
print(type(a))
print(a)

# Here, 1 would not be printed twice. Since, we have a
# set likewise we have in mathematics.

# Moreover, an empty set is a dictionary.
a = {}
print(type(a))

# If you wish to create an empty set. Use the following syntax:
b = set()
print(type(b))

# Don't forget to write set. Otherwise, it will create a tuple.
